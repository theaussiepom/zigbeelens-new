# ZigbeeLens Home Assistant integration

ZigbeeLens connects Home Assistant to **ZigbeeLens Core** — the read-only observability engine for Zigbee2MQTT. This integration is the Home Assistant control surface: summary entities, a native companion panel, diagnostics, and repairs.

The HACS sidebar panel is a polished **native companion panel** — a status and launcher surface, not the full product UI. The full ZigbeeLens dashboard is served by Core and opens in a new tab with one obvious button. This works for normal Docker installs **without a reverse proxy**, and avoids the browser mixed-content block that occurs when Home Assistant uses HTTPS and Core uses HTTP.

## What this integration does

- Connects Home Assistant to ZigbeeLens Core over HTTP
- Adds summary sensors and binary sensors for automations
- Registers a native companion panel showing connection, health, incidents, networks, devices, and collector status
- Provides an obvious **Open Full ZigbeeLens dashboard** button (opens Core in a new tab)
- Exposes redacted diagnostics
- Creates repairs for Core/collector/configuration issues

## What this integration does not do

- Does **not** collect Zigbee2MQTT data directly
- Does **not** replace ZigbeeLens Core or store main history in Home Assistant
- Does **not** mutate Zigbee devices
- Does **not** publish MQTT commands or request topics
- Does **not** require Lovelace YAML

## Prerequisites

Run ZigbeeLens Core using one of:

- **Home Assistant OS add-on** — install and start the ZigbeeLens add-on
- **Docker / Compose** — run the standalone container, e.g. `http://host:8377`

## Install via HACS

Published repository: **https://github.com/theaussiepom/zigbeelens-hacs**

1. Run ZigbeeLens Core (see [docs/release-test.md](../../docs/release-test.md) for `:edge` pre-release testing).
2. **HACS → Integrations → Custom repositories** → add the URL above (Category: Integration).
3. Install **ZigbeeLens** and restart Home Assistant if prompted.
4. **Settings → Devices & services → Add Integration → ZigbeeLens**.

Monorepo packaging for maintainers:

```bash
./scripts/package-hacs-repo.sh
```

Output: `dist/zigbeelens-hacs/` (push to the HACS repo).

### Core URL and embedded view

The Core URL is the address Home Assistant uses to reach ZigbeeLens Core.

HTTP Core URLs are the normal Docker path and work for the native companion panel, entities, repairs, diagnostics, and **Open Full Dashboard**.

The optional embedded dashboard view usually requires an **HTTPS Core URL** when Home Assistant is served over HTTPS. Configure this through **Settings → Devices & services → ZigbeeLens → Configure** — no need to delete and re-add the integration.

See [docs/hacs-embedded-view.md](../../docs/hacs-embedded-view.md) for HTTPS reverse proxy options (Traefik on Beast, Caddy example, etc.).

## Configure

During setup you will be asked for:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Core URL | Address of your ZigbeeLens Core dashboard — must be reachable **from Home Assistant**. HTTP is fine for the native panel and **Open Full Dashboard**. Use HTTPS if you want the optional embedded dashboard view inside Home Assistant. |
| Verify SSL | Enable TLS certificate verification |
| Panel enabled | Show the ZigbeeLens companion panel in the Home Assistant sidebar |
| Polling interval | How often summary entities refresh (default 60s) |

Examples: `http://192.168.1.10:8377`, `https://zigbeelens.example.com`

The config flow validates connectivity with `GET /api/health`.

Change the Core URL later without deleting the integration: **Settings → Devices & services → ZigbeeLens → Configure**.

### URL hints

| Deployment | Typical Core URL |
|------------|-------------------|
| Docker on LAN (pre-release) | `http://<docker-host-ip>:8377` |
| Docker Compose same network | `http://zigbeelens:8377` |
| HAOS add-on (same namespace) | `http://localhost:8377` |

## Entities

### Binary sensors

- **ZigbeeLens Active Incident** — on when active incidents exist
- **ZigbeeLens Core Connected** — on when the last coordinator refresh succeeded
- **ZigbeeLens MQTT Collector Connected** — on when Core reports the collector is connected

### Summary sensors

- Overall health, incident state, unavailable devices, recently unstable devices
- Router risks, stale devices, weak link devices, low battery devices, unknown devices
- Network count, device count

### Per-network sensors

For each configured network:

- `<Network> Health`
- `<Network> Unavailable Devices`
- `<Network> Router Risks`

Detailed diagnostics remain in the ZigbeeLens Core dashboard.

## Companion panel

When enabled, **ZigbeeLens** appears in the Home Assistant sidebar. When HA and Core use the same protocol (both HTTP or both HTTPS), the **full Core dashboard** loads automatically. Use the **menu button** (☰) to reopen Home Assistant's main navigation. Mixed content (HTTPS HA + HTTP Core) falls back to the native summary plus **Open Full Dashboard**.

The panel shows:

- Connection state and overall health
- Current finding and active incident count
- Stats: incidents, networks, devices, unavailable, router risks
- Per-network summaries (device count, bridge state)
- Integration health: Core URL, collector status, last update
- A prominent **Open full ZigbeeLens dashboard** button (opens Core in a new tab — primary, always reliable)
- **Try Embedded View** (optional manual iframe — not used on load)
- **Copy Core URL** and **Reload status**

The default view is always the **native summary panel** — it does not iframe Core and works the same whether Core is HTTP or HTTPS. **Open Full Dashboard** opens Core in a new tab. **Try Embedded View** is optional and only loads when you click it. No reverse proxy is required for normal use.

To enable embedded view when Home Assistant is HTTPS, put Core behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and update the **Core URL**. See **[HACS embedded view — optional HTTPS reverse proxy](../../docs/hacs-embedded-view.md)** (includes a Caddy Compose example).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---------|----------------|
| Core unreachable | Core URL, container/add-on running, firewall |
| Panel shows "not responding" | Core URL reachable from Home Assistant; container/add-on running; click Reload status |
| Open Dashboard button | Opens Core in a new tab; if the tab fails, Core itself is unreachable from your browser/LAN |
| Add-on vs Docker URL | Use a URL reachable from Home Assistant Core, not your browser only |
| Collector disconnected | MQTT settings in Core; broker reachable from Core |
| No devices showing | Networks configured in Core; MQTT traffic observed |
| Mock mode active | Core running with mock scenarios — expected for demos, not production |
| Version mismatch | Upgrade Core and integration together |

## Development

```bash
./scripts/validate-ha-integration.sh
```

Tests live in `apps/ha_integration/tests/`.

## Safety

This integration is read-only. It never publishes MQTT, sends Zigbee2MQTT request topics, or mutates Zigbee state.
