# ZigbeeLens

**Read-only diagnostics for Zigbee2MQTT networks.**

Understand your Zigbee mesh before you change it.

ZigbeeLens is a read-only observability and diagnostic console for Zigbee2MQTT networks. It watches Zigbee2MQTT over MQTT, keeps local history, detects health and instability patterns, explains likely scope using evidence and limitations, and generates redacted reports for troubleshooting.

ZigbeeLens does **not** repair, reset, remove, re-pair, or mutate Zigbee devices.

## What it is

- Read-only observability for Zigbee2MQTT
- Incident-first diagnostic dashboard
- Multi-network support (`network_id` + `ieee_address` identity)
- Router and mesh risk visibility
- Local SQLite history and stored reports
- Redacted JSON, YAML, and Markdown exports
- Home Assistant OS add-on, Docker/Compose, HACS integration
- Optional MQTT Discovery summary entities
- Optional topology snapshots and Home Assistant enrichment

## What it is not

- Not a Zigbee controller
- Not a Zigbee2MQTT replacement
- Not a repair tool
- Not a root-cause oracle
- Not a Lovelace dashboard recipe

## Key safety promises

- Does not remove devices
- Does not reset devices
- Does not permit join
- Does not change channels
- Does not configure, bind, or unbind devices
- Does not run OTA
- Does not publish Zigbee2MQTT `set` or request topics (except one optional, confirmed network-map request)
- Topology capture is optional and explicitly confirmed
- Reports are redacted before storage and download

See [docs/safety-audit.md](docs/safety-audit.md) for the full safety audit.

## Screenshots

Real screenshots from a live Beast deployment (`home` + `home2` networks). See [docs/screenshots/](docs/screenshots/) for source files.

### ZigbeeLens Core dashboard

![ZigbeeLens Overview dashboard](docs/screenshots/overview-dashboard.png)

The Overview page is the default entry point: live collector status, active incidents, network summaries, and evidence-backed findings.

### Home Assistant HACS companion panel

![HACS native companion panel](docs/screenshots/hacs-companion-panel.png)

The HACS integration provides a native companion panel plus **Open Full Dashboard** (new tab). HTTP Core URLs work for this path — no reverse proxy required.

![HACS embedded view blocked explanation](docs/screenshots/hacs-embedded-blocked.png)

When Home Assistant uses HTTPS and Core uses HTTP, the panel shows a calm explanation instead of a broken iframe. Use an HTTPS Core URL only if you want embedded view — see [docs/hacs-embedded-view.md](docs/hacs-embedded-view.md).

### HACS config flow

The setup dialog explains HTTP vs HTTPS Core URLs, optional SSL verification, and the sidebar companion panel toggle.

| Path | Repo |
|------|------|
| [Home Assistant OS add-on](docs/addon-dev.md) | [theaussiepom/zigbeelens-addons](https://github.com/theaussiepom/zigbeelens-addons) |

| [Topology](docs/topology.md) | Optional mesh enrichment — disabled by default |

## Quick start

### Home Assistant OS

1. Add the ZigbeeLens add-on repository.
2. Install and configure the ZigbeeLens add-on (MQTT broker, network `base_topic` values).
3. Start the add-on.
4. Open ZigbeeLens via Ingress.

Details: [docs/addon-dev.md](docs/addon-dev.md)

### Docker

```bash
mkdir -p config data
cp deploy/docker/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config/config.yaml — set mqtt.server and networks[].base_topic

./scripts/build-docker.sh
docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.example.yaml up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8377**

Details: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md)

### Home Assistant / HACS integration

The HACS integration is optional. It gives Home Assistant:

- a native ZigbeeLens companion panel
- summary sensors and binary sensors
- diagnostics and repairs
- a button to open the full ZigbeeLens dashboard

The full ZigbeeLens dashboard is served by ZigbeeLens Core.

For Docker users, an HTTP Core URL such as `http://192.168.1.10:8377` is fine. The native Home Assistant panel works, and the **Open Full Dashboard** button opens the full dashboard in a new tab.

The optional **Try Embedded View** button can show the full dashboard inside Home Assistant only when browser security allows it. In practice, if Home Assistant is served over HTTPS, the ZigbeeLens Core URL also needs to be HTTPS for embedded view to work.

You do not need HTTPS or a reverse proxy for normal HACS use. Change the Core URL anytime under **Settings → Devices & services → ZigbeeLens → Configure**.

### Development (mock scenarios)

```bash
pnpm install
python3 -m venv apps/core/.venv && source apps/core/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -e "apps/core[dev]"
pnpm --filter @zigbeelens/shared build
export ZIGBEELENS_CONFIG=config/config.yaml
./scripts/dev.sh
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and switch mock scenarios from the header dropdown.

## Configuration

Key settings in `config.yaml`:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mqtt.server` | MQTT broker URI |
| `networks[].id` | Stable network identifier — do not change casually |
| `networks[].name` | Display label only |
| `networks[].base_topic` | Zigbee2MQTT base topic (must match exactly) |
| `storage.path` | SQLite database path |
| `storage.retention_days` | Telemetry retention |
| `diagnostics.*` | Health and incident thresholds |
| `reports.*` | Report limits and defaults |
| `topology.enabled` | **false** by default |
| `features.mqtt_discovery` + `mqtt_discovery.enabled` | **false** by default |

See [deploy/docker/config.example.yaml](deploy/docker/config.example.yaml) for a full example.

## Reports

Generate scoped diagnostic reports from the Reports page or `POST /api/reports`.

- **JSON** — structured data for tools
- **YAML** — human-readable structured export
- **Markdown** — forum and GitHub friendly

Redaction profiles: `standard`, `public_safe`, `strict`. Reports are redacted **before** storage and download.

Details: [docs/reports.md](docs/reports.md) · [docs/redaction.md](docs/redaction.md)

## Known limitations

- ZigbeeLens observes MQTT and Zigbee2MQTT data — it cannot prove RF interference.
- It cannot prove the current physical route without an optional topology snapshot.
- Topology is point-in-time and may be slow or unavailable on large networks.
- Battery and LQI reporting vary by device firmware and configuration.
- Availability depends on Zigbee2MQTT `availability` feature being enabled.
- Some sleepy end devices report infrequently by design.
- Diagnostics use correlation language — not definitive root-cause claims.

## Security

- Local-first: no cloud sync, data stays on your host
- Secrets are redacted from logs and reports
- No Zigbee mutation — subscribe-only collector by default
- Standalone Docker should sit on a trusted LAN or behind a reverse proxy
